Workday timetable is simple calendar app that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. The app keeps track of time by changing the colors of the taskbox throughout the day (Grey ⚪️ for the past, Green 🟢 for the future, and Red 🔴 for the present). Users can update tasks by double clicking on the task box itself, entering the task for that time, and clicking the blue "save" button. The app stores User input, so they can return to check their schedule throughout the day.
This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The app includes styling by Bootstrap, Font Awesome, Open Iconic and Google Fonts. Developed on following criteria-

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
