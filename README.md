# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This project uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a workday time-table. For the challenge, we were given starter code, which uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library (a "legacy" product) to work with date and time.

Based on the user story-
("AS AN employee with a busy schedule, I WANT to add important events to a daily planner, SO THAT I can manage my time effectively.")
Workday timetable is simple calendar app that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The app features styling by Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and Google Fonts. Developed on following criteria-

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
