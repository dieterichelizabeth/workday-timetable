Step 1: Set up the HTML
    done - Center the text
    - add the Current date under the p (id currentDay)

Done Step 2: 
    - add blocks of time 9,10,11,12,1,2,3,4,5 (9 total)
    - blocks should be generated w/ jQuery on load of the page
        - each "block" of time will have a text area
            - the text area will allow typing (click on and highlight)
        - each "block" of time will have a blue save button w/ disk icon
            - when the blue button is pressed, the text saves to local storage for the day
    - changes to be saved to local storage
    
Done Step 3: 
    - Time should change the color of the box (box backgrounds will start green)
    - The box will have a red background if it is that hour
    - the box will turn gray if the hour has passed
        - use conditional statements
        - will need to be able to get the current time of the user for the function
        - best for military time
Step 4: styling
    - button styling for the save
    - font styling
